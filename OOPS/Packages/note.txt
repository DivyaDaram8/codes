Packages are used to organize related classes and interfaces, avoid naming conflicts, provide access control, and promote code reusability.

Basic Info:
- A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.
- Packages help to avoid class name conflicts.
- They provide controlled access to classes and interfaces.
- Packages can be nested within other packages.
- The `import` statement is used to include classes from other packages.
- The `package` statement defines the package name at the beginning of a source file.
- Nesting of folders also included but need to change commands while compiling like below:
    PS C:\JavaPrac\OOPS> javac Packages/folderA/innerFolderA/P2.java Packages/folderA/Pri
ncipal.java Packages/MyClass.java
