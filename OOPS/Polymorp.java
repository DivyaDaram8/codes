public class Polymorp {
    
}

//NOTES:
// 1. Polymorphism is of 2types: Compile-time polymorphism and Run-time polymorphism.
// 2. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved by method overloading.
// 3. Method overloading is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

// 4. Run-time polymorphism is achieved by method overriding.
// 5. Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class.



// Dynamic Binding is when the method call is resolved at runtime, Enabling Runtime polymorphism.
